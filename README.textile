Note: I haven't used Glimpse, so I could be mistaken in some areas, correct me if I'm wrong ;)

h3. Shortcomings
* Only works for Chrome (easily modifiable)
* Configured to right alt (though again, easily modifiable)
* Only tested by me (Anthony)

Glimpse looks like an awesome development tool.  I took a piece of Glimpse and made it work more generally.  Honestly though Glimpse looks much more rhobust and pretty than what I've done - I mainly wanted soemthing now that worked well with the development enviornment I regularly use.
